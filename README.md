# VirusTotal URL Analysis Script 🚀🔍

This script reads a list of URLs from a CSV file, analyzes them using the VirusTotal API, and generates a report with detailed threat information. The results are saved to a new CSV file, and logs are maintained for debugging purposes. 📊🛠️

## Features ✨

- 📄 Reads URLs from a CSV file
- 🛡️ Analyzes URLs using the VirusTotal API
- 📊 Retrieves detected threats, total scans, scan date, scan ID, permalink, and categories
- 💾 Saves analysis results to a new CSV file
- ⏳ Displays a progress bar with estimated time remaining
- 📝 Logs detailed information for debugging
- 🔧 Automatically installs required packages from `requirements.txt` if available

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation 💻

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    requests
    pandas
    click
    tqdm
    ```

## Setup 🔧

1. Obtain a VirusTotal API key from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).
2. Set the `VT_API_KEY` environment variable:
    ```bash
    export VT_API_KEY='your_virustotal_api_key'
    ```

## Usage ▶️

1. Prepare a CSV file with a column named `Domain` containing the URLs to be analyzed.
2. Run the script with the path to your CSV file as an argument:
    ```bash
    python VTUAnalyzer.py path_to_your_csv_file.csv
    ```

## Example 🌟

The script will:
- 📄 Read the URLs from `domains.csv`
- 🛡️ Analyze each URL using the VirusTotal API
- ⏳ Display a progress bar with the estimated time remaining
- 💾 Save the results to `vt_results.csv`
- 📝 Log detailed information to `vt_analysis.log`

## Output 📊

The output CSV file (`vt_results.csv`) will contain columns:
- `URL`
- `Detected Threats`
- `Total Scans`
- `Scan Date`
- `Scan ID`
- `Permalink`
- `Category`

## Logging 📝

Logs detailed information about the script execution to `vt_analysis.log`, including:
- Requests made to the VirusTotal API
- Responses received
- Progress information
- Errors and warnings

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- Ensure your VirusTotal API key is correctly set in the `VT_API_KEY` environment variable
